      Number using O5 and O6:                  332
    Number used as Memory:                   1,838 out of  24,320    7%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:             55
        Number using O6 output only:            55
      Number used as Shift Register:         1,783
        Number using O6 output only:         1,783
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:       138
  Number of route-thrus:                     1,306 out of 117,760    1%
    Number using O6 output only:             1,253
    Number using O5 output only:                53

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 4,070 out of  14,720   27%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       12,639
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,402 out of  12,639   11%
    Number with an unused LUT:               2,851 out of  12,639   22%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       8,386 out of  12,639   66%
    Number of unique control sets:             240
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             485 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       124 out of     640   19%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             98

    Number using BlockRAM only:                 42
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               9
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:              66
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,512 out of   8,784   17%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
