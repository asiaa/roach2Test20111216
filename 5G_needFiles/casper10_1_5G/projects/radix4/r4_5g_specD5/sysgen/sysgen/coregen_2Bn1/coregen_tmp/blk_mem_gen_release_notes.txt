RELEASE NOTES for Block Memory Generator v2.4 rev 1
===================================================

1. System Requirements
  
   - Platform Support information for this core version is described in the
     Release Notes AR for ISE 9.1i IP Update 1:
     http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xil_ans_display.jsp?getPagePath=24307

  - Special Requirements for this core version:
    ISE 9.1i Service Pack 2

2. Enhancements

   - Support for ECC (built-in Hamming error correction) in Virtex-5

   - Support for Spartan(TM)-3A DSP

3. Bugs Fixed

    - Block Memory Generator resource utilization is non-optimal for 
      certain configurations
          Change Request: 429967

    - Block Memory Generator GUI displays unselectable options
          Change Request: 415531

4. Known Issues

    - Core does not generate for large memories.  Depending on the
      machine Coregen runs on, the maximum size of the memory that
      can be generated will vary.  For example, a Dual Pentium-4
      server running at 3.6GHz with 2 Gig RAM can generate a memory 
      core of size 1.8 MBits or 230 K Bytes.
          Change Request: 225405

    - Out-of-range address input can cause the core to generate X's
      on the DOUT bus.

    - Block Memory Generator GUI fails with an internal error if no
      value is entered for Write Depth.
          Change Request: 432931
