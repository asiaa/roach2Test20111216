    Number used as Memory:                   2,573 out of  24,320   10%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:             87
        Number using O6 output only:            87
      Number used as Shift Register:         2,486
        Number using O6 output only:         2,486
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:       181
  Number of route-thrus:                     1,710 out of 117,760    1%
    Number using O6 output only:             1,663
    Number using O5 output only:                47

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 5,980 out of  14,720   40%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       16,366
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,767 out of  16,366   10%

    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      10,585 out of  16,366   64%
    Number of unique control sets:             273
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             552 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              24
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:              98
    Total Memory used (KB):                  2,628 out of   8,784   29%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      5 out of      32   15%
