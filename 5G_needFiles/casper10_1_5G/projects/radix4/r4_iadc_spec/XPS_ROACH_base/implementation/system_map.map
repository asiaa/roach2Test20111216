Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 5,458 out of  14,720   37%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       16,032
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,590 out of  16,032    9%

    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      10,548 out of  16,032   65%
    Number of unique control sets:             281
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             556 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                        94 out of     640   14%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             83

    IOB Slave Pads:                              1

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                      58 out of     244   23%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                 58
    Total primitives used:
