\BlockDesc{
\paragraph{Usage}
The top output, \textit{a+b}, is a complex output whose real part equals the sum of the real parts of \textit{a} and \textit{b}. The imaginary part of \textit{a+b} equals the difference of the imaginary parts of \textit{a} and \textit{b}. The bottom output, \textit{a-b}, is a complex output whose real part equals the sum of the imaginary parts of \textit{a} and \textit{b}.The imaginary part of \textit{a-b} equals the difference of the real parts of \textit{b} and \textit{a}. The latency of this block is 2*\textit{add\_latency}.
