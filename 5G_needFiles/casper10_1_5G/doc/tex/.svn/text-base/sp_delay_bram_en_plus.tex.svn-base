{A delay block that uses BRAM for its storage and only shifts when enabled. However, BRAM latency cannot be enabled, so output appears bram\_latency clocks after an enable.}



\begin{ParameterTable}

\Parameter{Enabled Delays}{DelayLen}{The length of the delay.}

\Parameter{Extra (unenabled) delay for BRAM Latency}{bram\_latency}{The latency of the underlying storage BRAM.}

\end{ParameterTable}



\begin{PortTable}

\Port{in}{in}{???}{The signal to be delayed.}

\Port{en}{in}{???}{To be asserted when input is valid.}

\Port{out}{out}{???}{The delayed signal.}

\Port{valid}{out}{???}{Asserted when output is valid.}
