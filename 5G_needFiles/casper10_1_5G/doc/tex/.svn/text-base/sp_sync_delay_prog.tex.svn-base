\Block{The Programmable Sync Delay Block}{sync\_delay\_prog}{syncdelayprog}{Aaron Parsons}{Aaron Parsons}{Delay an infrequent boolean pulse by a run-time programmable number of enabled clocks. If the input pulse repeats before the output pulse is generated, an internal counter resets and that output pulse is never generated. When delay is changed, some randomly determined samples will be inserted/dropped from the buffered stream.}
