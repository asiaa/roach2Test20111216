\Block{DAC}{dac}{dac}{Henry Chen}{Ben Blackman}{The DAC block converts 4 digital inputs to 1 analog output. The \textit{dac} runs at 4x FPGA clock frequency, outputting analog converted samples 0 through 3 each FPGA clock cycle.}


\begin{ParameterTable}
\Parameter{DAC board}{dac\_brd}{Select which IBOB port to run this \textit{dac}.}
\Parameter{DAC clock rate (MHz)}{dac\_clk\_rate}{The clock rate to run the \textit{dac}. Must be 4x FPGA clock rate.}
\Parameter{Sample period}{sample\_period}{Sets the period at which the \textit{dac} outputs samples (ie 2 means every other cycle).}
\Parameter{Show Implementation Parameters}{show\_param}{Allows the user to set the implementation parameters.}
\Parameter{Invert output clock phase}{invert\_clock}{When unchecked, the \textit{dac} samples the data aligned with the clock. When checked, the \textit{dac} samples the data aligned with an inverted clock.}
\end{ParameterTable}

\begin{PortTable}
\Port{dataX}{IN}{Fix\_9\_8}{One of 4 digital inputs to be converted to analog.}
\Port{sim\_out}{OUT}{double}{Analog output of \textit{dac}. Note: For simulation only.}

\BlockDesc{
\paragraph{Usage}
The \textit{dac} takes 4 \textit{Fix\_9\_8} inputs and outputs an analog stream. The \textit{dac} runs at 4x the FPGA clock speed.
