\begin{PortTable}
\Port{a}{IN}{Inherited}{The first number to be multiplied by \textit{factor}. It usually is the real component of an input.}

\Port{a\_out}{OUT}{Inherited}{The input \textit{a} delayed by 1 cycle.}
\Port{b\_out}{OUT}{Inherited}{The input \textit{b} delayed by 1 cycle.}
\Port{real}{OUT}{Inherited}{The result of the multiplication of \textit{a} with \textit{factor}.}

\BlockDesc{
\paragraph{Usage}
\textit{a\_out} and \textit{b\_out} are 1 cycle delayed versions of \textit{a} and \textit{b}, respectively. \textit{real} and \textit{imag} are the results of \textit{a} * \textit{factor} and \textit{b} * \textit{factor}, respectively. The delay from \textit{a} to \textit{real} or \textit{b} to \textit{imag} is equal to \textit{latency}.
