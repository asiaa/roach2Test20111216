\BlockDesc{This block counts the number of clocks between a start and stop pulse. This value is held until a reset is received. If another start pulse is received before the reset, counting resumes from where it left-off. If a reset is received mid-way through a count (ie before a stop pulse) then the stopwatch will be reset and await another start pulse before it restarts counting. Test Model: test\_stopwatch.mdl}
