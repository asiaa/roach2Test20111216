\Block{Power}{power}{power}{Aaron Parsons}{Ben Blackman}{Computes the power of a complex number.}

\begin{ParameterTable}
\Parameter{Bit Width}{BitWidth}{The number of bits in its input.}
\end{ParameterTable}

\begin{PortTable}
\Port{c}{IN}{2*BitWidth Fixed point}{A complex number whose higher BitWidth bits are its real part and lower BitWidth bits are its imaginary part.}
\Port{power}{OUT}{UFix\_(2*BitWidth)\_(2*BitWidth-1)}{The computed power of the input complex number.}
\end{PortTable}

\BlockDesc{
\paragraph{Usage}
The power block typically has a latency of 5 and will compute the power of its input by taking the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary components.
