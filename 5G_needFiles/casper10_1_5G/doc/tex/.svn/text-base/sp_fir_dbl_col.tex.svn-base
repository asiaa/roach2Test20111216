\BlockDesc{
\paragraph{Usage}
This block takes in a number of inputs in parallel and outputs a delayed version of them and also multiplies the inputs by the coefficients. Then \textit{real\_sum} and \textit{imag\_sum} are computed and are delayed due to the latency in the adders which depends both on the \textit{add\_latency} and the number of inputs. For example, if you choose the number of inputs to be 2, then there will be 2 \textit{real} and 2 \textit{real\_back} input ports along with 2 \textit{imag} and 2 \textit{imag\_back} input ports. The FIR Double Column blocks takes advantage of the symmetric filter tap coefficients by adding the first and last inputs together before multiplying by the coefficient. This results in a more efficient FIR filter column.
