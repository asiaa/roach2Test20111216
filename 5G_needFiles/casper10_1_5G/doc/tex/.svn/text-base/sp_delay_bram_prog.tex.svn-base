{A delay block that uses BRAM for its storage and has a run-time programmable delay. When delay is changed, some randomly determined samples will be inserted/dropped from the buffered stream.}



\begin{ParameterTable}

\Parameter{Max Delay (2$^?$)}{MaxDelay}{The maximum length of the delay (i.e. the BRAM Size).}

\Parameter{BRAM Latency}{bram\_latency}{The latency of the underlying storage BRAM.}

\end{ParameterTable}



\begin{PortTable}

\Port{din}{in}{???}{The signal to be delayed.}

\Port{delay}{in}{???}{The run-time programmable delay length.}

\Port{dout}{in}{???}{The delayed signal.}

\end{PortTable}
